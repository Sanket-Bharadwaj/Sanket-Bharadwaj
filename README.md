### 🧠 Who I Am

I'm Sanket — a full-stack problem solver who loves mixing clean design with smart code.

I build polished, high-performance web tools and AI systems that actually do something useful. Whether it’s a futuristic UI with glassmorphism and water physics, a hardware project on an ESP32, or a neural network trained from scratch — I’m always building things that feel alive and sharp.

I believe great tech should look good, feel good, and help someone — all at once.

### 💡 Philosophy

> "If it looks good, feels good, and actually helps someone — that's when I know it's worth shipping."

I love performance, polish, and purpose. I don’t believe in overengineering. I believe in **shipping**.

### 🧪 Side Experiments

- Training AI to recommend phones through chat — no API, no shortcuts.
- Building local-first, offline-first web apps with zero cloud dependency.
- Designing with motion in mind — from hover states to full-on ambient UX.
